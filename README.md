# jDiameter

jDiameter repo but I change some pom.xml so that it works for me. jDiameter is the Java implementation of AAA protocol Diameter, which is the successor of RADIUS, used in 4g/LTE. I had been reading it inside out when doing my internship at [Viettel Cyber Security](https://viettelcybersecurity.com/). 

Sadly my project is hosted on their GitLab and cannot be disclosed, but it gave me a lot of Java development and Database, MessageQueue programming experience.

If you have time play around with this... Don't do so! Original source code can be found [here](https://github.com/RestComm/jdiameter)
